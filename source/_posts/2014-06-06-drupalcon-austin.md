DrupalCon Austin is over. This was the first time in a few years that
I didn't have to man a booth or go to meetings for the majority of my
time. That gave me a lot more time to attend talks, BoFs, and just
have conversations with lots of different Drupalistas.

## Highlights

For some reason this year the "hallway track" was the biggest
highlight of the trip, which hasn't been the case for me at previous
DrupalCons. A lot of good conversations came out of the talks I
attended and by just meeting folks in the hall that had similar
interests. I wanted to focus a lot on testing a development and
deployment automation tools and while there were some pretty good
talks on both they really served to spark interest and some really
good conversations with other folks interested in the same topics.

[VML](http://www.vml.com) (the company I work for) and
[Blink Reaction]() got together to host a BoF on
[Aligning Digital Creative Services With Drupal Planning and Development](https://austin2014.drupal.org/bof/aligning-digital-creative-services-drupal-planning-and-development). It
was great to get a group of folks from different organizations to talk
about the problems and solutions around the challenges with
integrating designers with Drupal developers.

I also had some great conversations around BDD and Behat, something
I've been looking into as a solution for automated acceptance and
regression testing. There's a **lot** of new thinking and work going
on in this space right now and I think we'll see a lot coming out
about it over the next few weeks and months. One new thing that came
out during DrupalCon was the new
[BehatRunner](https://drupal.org/project/behatrunner) module which
provides a way for modules to provide Behat tests and have them
auto-discovered and run via Drush or the admin UI. I've only played
with it a little but it's really slick and looks to be something that
will reduce the friction for getting folks to write and run Behat
tests quite a bit.

## Lowlights

The only real lowlights this year were a couple of really sub-par
sesions and keynotes. I know the
[Drupal Association](https://assoc.drupal.org) does a ton of work to
ensure this doesn't happen so it was really surprising.

## What's Next

Next up for me is [DrupalCorn Camp 2014](http://2014.drupalcorn.org/) in
July where I'll hopefull be giving a couple of talks on custom
[theming [with Sass, Compass, and Susy](http://2014.drupalcorn.org/session/creating-mobile-first-responsive-themes-sass-compass-and-susy)
as well as
[testing with Behat](http://2014.drupalcorn.org/session/enabling-automated-bdd-testing-drupal-behat). If
you're in the midwest I can't recommend this camp enough.
