title: Zsh and Solarized

For a while now I've been hearing that all the cool kids are using [zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/) and the [solarized color scheme](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) and I finally got a chance to try them out a couple of weeks ago.

## Zsh
Zsh has a number of apparent advantages over bash, the shell I've been using for eons. I'm sure I've only scratched the surface but here are a few of the features that I'm liking better than bash. And yes, I know that bash may have some of these or they can be added to bash, I just like the way they work in zsh better.

* More flexible prompt config - the right side prompt is pretty cool.
* Cleaner scripting syntax.
* Better command line editing.
* Better completion.
* A few other simple things, like being able to associate a file type with a program - just type the file name and it opens in the program.

I've also found that starting with [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) is a Good Thing. It's a "framework" for configuring your shell, the git plugin is worth the five minutes you'll spend setting it up.

## Solarized
[Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) is a color scheme designed for terminals and gui applications. A ton of thought and testing has gone into the selection of colors and, in my opinion, is a *lot* better than any color scheme I've tried. As I've gotten older I've noticed that my eyes get tired sooner, I need a lot more contrast and I just suffer more overall from eye strain that I used to. Solarized helps me a lot. The only thing I needed to add to the stock release was a [Solarized xfce4-terminal color scheme](https://github.com/sgerrand/xfce4-terminal-colors-solarized). Solarized has become so popular that it should be a simple matter of googling for what might be missing.
