title: DrupalCorn Camp 2014

If you've never been to a Drupal camp you're really missing out. Camps
are kind of like conventions but they're smaller and a whole lot
easier to participate in. The talks are more like discussions than
lectures, it's easy for everyone to interact with anyone else, and
it's a great opportunity for anyone to give back to the
community. I've been to [DrupalCorn](http://2014.drupalcorn.org/) for
the last two years and both times I've come away feeling like the
experience was more valuable and rewarding than just about anything
else I've done in the community that year.

## Keynotes and Talks

The
[first keynote](http://2014.drupalcorn.org/keynote-jen-lampton-and-nate-haug)
was Jen Lampton and Nate Haug discussing
[Backdrop](http://backdropcms.org/), a fork of Drupal. It had been a
while since I had really paid much attention to the project and it was
really interesting to hear the reasoning and rational that went into
the decision to create Backdrop. The data and trends they shared
regarding the community particiapation over time for the Drupal
project, and the assumptions they were making about the reasons for
those trends, make a good case for Backdrop. I'm still not convinced
that the trends we've seen for Drupal over the life of the project are
necessarily a bad thing, or that the project isn't on the right
path. There are lots of reasons why participation in open source
projects change over time and some of those reasons have nothing to do
with the technical decisions and direction of the project. It will be
interesting to see how things play out as both Drupal 8 and Backdrop
near their release dates. Even though I'm sure I'll feel much more
comfortable with Drupal 8 Nate and Jen made a convincing argument for
having an additional (and complementary) option available for those
that prefer the model being used by Backdrop.

Josh Koenig gave the
[keynote on the second day](http://2014.drupalcorn.org/keynote-josh-koenig)
talking about the future of innovation an what he calls "the
integrated web". It was really interesting stuff and Josh is a very
dynamic speaker, which was a good thing for those who stayed up too
late playing [cornhole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornhole).

The talks were really good and certainly worth the time to watch if
any of the subjects seem interesting. They were all recorded and
posted to the [session pages](http://2014.drupalcorn.org/schedule) on
the DrupalCorn site but some had some audio issues so they may not all
be available or a bit hard to listen to.

## Speaking

This year I was lucky enough to be able to give two talks. The first
one was a response to a request on how to use Sass on Drupal projects,
[Creating Mobile First Responsive Themes With Sass, Compass and Susy](http://2014.drupalcorn.org/session/creating-mobile-first-responsive-themes-sass-compass-and-susy). The
second, and I think the more popular, was on
[Enabling Automated BDD Testing In Drupal With Behat](http://2014.drupalcorn.org/session/enabling-automated-bdd-testing-drupal-behat). Behat
is something I'm looking into more as a good way to do application and
acceptance testing in Drupal. There's a lot of interest in Behat and a
bunch of work being done within the Drupal community right now so
there's lots of opportunity to learn and opportunities to participate.

Two other VMLers, Andrew Koebbe and Chad Peppers, as well as Scott
Wilkinson went with me this year and all three got to speak as
well. Andrew gave a talk on
[So Sassy! An Intro to Sass and Compass](http://2014.drupalcorn.org/session/so-sassy-intro-sass-and-compass),
Chad's was
[Introduction to Entities](http://2014.drupalcorn.org/session/introduction-entities)
which was definitly a firehose of information, and Scott talked about
[Responsive Images with Picture & Breakpoints](http://2014.drupalcorn.org/session/responsive-images-picture-breakpoints).

## Code Sprint

I had a couple of opportunities to contribute while I was at
DrupalCorn, which is one of the biggest reasons I've enjoyed going to
DrupalCorn so much. Having time to do things like this is a rare
opportunity, my time is more often taken up using Drupal to build
client sites as opposed to contributing back to the project itself.

While I was getting ready for my talk on Behat I found a relatively
simple problem in the Behat Runner module that I was able to
[create a patch](https://www.drupal.org/node/2306385) for. There
hasn't been a lot of movement on the patch yet but it was rewarding to
find a problem and actually be part of the solution.

During the code sprint I had the pleasure of sitting right next to
[Cathy Theys](https://www.drupal.org/u/yesct). Not only is she awesome
at helping folks contribute to Drupal she helped me get my first core
contribution to Drupal ever. It was a small update but seeing this
tweet the day I got back from Iowa was an awesome feeling.

## A Big Thank You

This was my second year and the second year that my company
[VML](http://www.vml.com) has sponsored the camp and made it possible
for me to go. We've gotten a lot out of Drupal at VML and it's
fantastic to see us give back in such a great way.
